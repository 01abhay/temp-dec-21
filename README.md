### Dashboard UI (built with React/Shadcn)

#### Setup

- `cd` in to project dir, run following commands
  - `npm i`
  - `npm run dev`

### Best Practices followed

- use shadcn lib components as much as possible
- minimized color/font etc. overriding by efficiently utilizing theme
- made reusable components
- scalable folder structure
- example api usage in chat page, (API simulation using promise)

## Pixel perfect? almost. some styles may not match with figma, either they were not going well with design or to avoid forceful override I didn't apply them, as when using a lib I prefer lib's styles.
